# Some wishes and some improvement ideas

* Evaluate Podman as default
* Make tunables and switches into environment variables
  - RAM, # of CPUs, etc.
  - Switches
    - Docker vs. Podman
    * LinkerD install and config
    * Ingress install
    * Monitoring toggle
      - Prometheus/Grafana
      - Dashboard
    * 
  * Distro version? (Not sure if that should be tunable...)
* Sane logging setup (mimicking production, simple, keep `kubectl logs` functionality intact)
  - Jaeger? ECK?
